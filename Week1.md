# Week1 Introduction to Information Systems

## 1 System

* A ‘system’ is set of inter-related components (parts) or subsystems.
* For **teleological** systems, a ‘system’ is made up of inter-related components that work together to achieve the overall objectives of the whole system

## 2 System Approach (System thinking)

* Definition

> The systems approach or systems thinking is a method of analysing or thinking about complex systems from the perspective of the total system, the goals of the overall system, the individual components or subsystems, and the inter- relationships and inter-dependencies between the components.

## 3 Systems Theory

* It is the transdisciplinary study of the abstract organization of complex phenomena, independent of their substance, type, or temporal scale of existence.

* It investigates both the principles common to all complex entities, and the models (usually mathematical) that can be used to represent them.

## 4 Structure of a system

* Overall objective represented as concrete measure(s) of performance
* Inputs and Resources
* Process(es)
* Feedback Mechanisms
* Outputs
* System Boundary
* System Environment

## 5 Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom

* Data
  * Raw material
  * Representation of facts
  * Maybe numeric, text, etc.
  * Is usually pricessed further
  * Context free
* Information
  * Processed data
  * In a specific context. Contextual indications, such as a label, are needed to turn data into information
  * Meaningful and useful to the user
* Knowledge
  * Ability to understand information, form opinions, and make decisions or predictions
  * Knowledge is a body of governing procedures, such as guidelines or rules, that are used to organize or manipulate data to make it suitable for a given task.

## 6 Information Systems

> Information Systems **collects**, **processes**, **stores**, **analyzes**, and **disseminates** information for **a specific purpose**

* IS as a discipline
  * Combines the technical and behavioral approach
  * Social-technical system
* IS as a product
  * Seen from users’ point of view, e.g. Billing System, web auction system
  * Consists of different elements, e.g., IT, procedures, content

## 7 Components of Information Systems

* Hardware
  * A device such as a processor, monitor, keyboard, or printer
* Software
  * A program or collection of programs that enable the hardware to process data
* Database
  * A collection of related files or tables containing data
* Network
  * A connecting system that permits different computers to share resources
* Procedures
  * The set of instructions for combining the above components in order to process information and generate the desired output
* People
  * Individuals who use the hardware and software, interface with it, or utilize the output

## 8 Socio-technical systems

* Most ISs have a technical component and a social (human/organisational/societal) component which interact with each other in multiple ways.
* Optimising the technical component without improving the social component is known to produce poor outcomes and results.

## 9 Categories of Information Systems

* Management Support Systems
* Operations Support Systems

## 10 IS and Organisational levels

| Kind of IS  | Groups served|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Strategic Level      | Senior Managers            |
| Management Level     | Middle Managers            |
| Knowledge Level      | Knowledge and Data Workers |
| Operational Level    | Operational Managers       |

  * Applications
  * Infrastructure
  * Processes
  * Policies
  * People
  * Database
  * Ideas

  * IS Security
  * Business Intelligence
  * E-Commerce
  * Knowledge management system
