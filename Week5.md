    1. Command Bank tap and pay is available to Android only. The mobile payment is only available to devices which are equipped with NFC modules and has minimum OS version requirement.
    2. Visa credit cards have a transaction limit of $100 and some CommBank cards are ineligible.
* GPT-4 Answer:
  1. **Limited device compatibility**: CommBank's mobile payment system currently supports specific devices, like Apple Pay for iOS devices and Google Pay for Android devices. This limitation may prevent some users with incompatible devices from accessing the service.
      * Suggestion: Work on expanding compatibility by supporting more mobile payment platforms, like Samsung Pay or other regional payment apps, to cater to a broader audience.
  2. **Limited to CommBank cards**: Users can only link CommBank cards to their mobile payment services. This can be inconvenient for those who have multiple bank accounts and credit cards from different financial institutions.
      * Suggestion: Partner with other banks or credit card providers to allow customers to link cards from multiple financial institutions, offering a more comprehensive mobile payment experience.
  3. **Security concerns**: Although the page claims to provide secure transactions, users may still have concerns about potential hacking or unauthorized access.
      * Suggestion: Regularly update the app's security features, implement robust multi-factor authentication, and educate users on best practices for safeguarding their accounts.

      * Suggestion: Collaborate with more merchants to increase the acceptance of mobile payments, and invest in campaigns to promote awareness and adoption of mobile payment technology
  5. **Limited to Australian transactions**: The mobile payment service may not work seamlessly with international transactions, which could be inconvenient for users who travel or shop overseas.
