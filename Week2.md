# Week2 Competitive Advantage

## 1 Definition

* An edge over competitors in attracting customers and defending against
competitive forces
* An advantage can be in terms of cost, quality, or speed; leads to control of
a market and to larger-than-average profits
* Questions
  * Q1: How long can you have competitive advantage/s?
  * Q2: How many competitive advantages do you need for your business?\
  * Q3: How can you make competitive advantage/s sustainable?
  * Q4: How can IS help you gain sustainable competitive advantage/s? (e.g., strategic IS and alignment?)

## 2 Information systems can be used in three ways to add value to an organisation

* Automating
  * Task can be completed faster, cheaper, more accurately, with greater consistency
* Learning
  * Learn about processes
  * Improve processes
* Strategising
  * Enable firm to gain or sustain competitive advantage

## 3 Five General Organizational (Competitive) Strategies

* Cost Leadership
  * Offer the best prices on goods and/or services
* Differentiation
  * Provide better products and/or services than competitors
* Broad Market
  * Aim broadly at many different types of customers
* Niche Market
  * Focus on a particular segment of consumers
* Best-Cost Provider
  * Offer products or services of reasonably good quality at competitive prices

## 4 Industry Analysis

## 5 Porter’s Five Forces Model

Five forces that shape competition and strategy

* Threat of new entrants
* Bargaining power of suppliers
* Bargaining power of buyers
* Threat of substitutes
* Rivalry among existing competitors

## 6 Threat of New Entrants

* The threat that new competitors will enter your market is high when entry is easy and low when there are significant barriers to entry.
* There are many types of **entry barriers**. Consider, for example, legal requirements such as admission to the bar to practice law or a license to serve liquor, where only a certain number of licenses are available.

### 6.1 Creating Barriers to Entry

* Supply-side economies of scale
* Network effects (Demand-side economies of scale)
* Customer switching costs
* Capital requirements
* Unequal access to distribution channels
* Restrictive government policy

## 7 Bargaining power of suppliers

* Supplier power is high when buyers have few choices from whom to buy and low when buyers have many choices.

## 8 Bargaining power of buyers

* Buyer power is high when buyers have many choices from whom to buy and low when buyers have few choices.
* For example, in the past, there were few locations where students could purchase textbooks (typically, one or two campus bookstores). In this situation, students had low buyer power. Today, the Web provides students with access to a multitude of potential suppliers as well as detailed information about textbooks. As a result, student buyer power has increased dramatically.

## 9 Rivalry Among Existing Competitors

* Rivalry takes many different forms:
  * Price discount
  * New product introduction
  * Advertising
  * Service improvement
* The threat from rivalry is high when there is intense competition among many firms in an industry. The threat is low when the competition is among fewer firms and is not as intense.
