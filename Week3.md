# Week3 IS infrastructure, services, and ethics

## 1 Managing IS Infrastructure

### 1.1 Challenges

* Rapid obsolescence and short IT cycles
* Big data and rapidly increasing storage needs
* Demand fluctuations
* Increasing energy needs

### 1.2 Issues

* How to integrate user's mobile devices into org's IS infrastructure
* When and how to upgrade the hardware and software infrastructure
* How to quickly sacle the IS infrastructure accordingly

### 1.3 Increasingly Faster IT Cycles and Consumerization

* Moore’s Law
    > Number of transistors on a chip would double about every two years
* Manufacturers release new devices every 6-12 months

### 1.4 Increasing Obsolescence

* New hardware enables more powerful software
* Powerful software requires new hardware
* Planned Obsolescence
  * Product is designed to last for a certain life span
  * Hardware are not built to be serviceable
  * Software support may cease (e.g., Windows XP)

### 1.5 Big Data and Rapidly Increasing Storage Needs

* Organizations collect and analyze vast amounts of data for business intelligence and other purposes (e.g., legal compliance)
* Vicious circle between enhanced capabilities of data and communications infrastructure and new applications

### 1.6 Demand Fluctuations

* Fluctuating demands for computing resources
  * Seasonal fluctuations (e.g., Christmas)
  * Monthly fluctuations (e.g., month-end spikes)
* Too few resources at some times or too many idle resources most of the time
  * Up to 70% of IS infrastructure is utilized at only 20% of its capacity
* Not easy to make quick changes to the IS infrastructure based on changing needs
* Especially difficult for new entrants
  * Not able to forecast demand
  * May not have the resources to quickly meet the increases in demand

### 1.7 Increasing Energy Needs

* More powerful hardware consumes more energy and generates more heat
  * More heat requires more energy for cooling
* Power and cooling can be a significant cost factor
  * A typical server rack consumes 15 to 17 kilowatts (power for $\gt$ 10 homes)

### 1.8 Cloud Computing

* refers to both the applications delivered as services over the internet and the hardware and systems software in the data centres that provides those services.

### 1.9 How Cloud Computing changing Management

* As cloud technology improves
  * A common repository for the collection and analysis of new data
  * The place where an increasing number of artificial intelligence operations, like image and speech recognition, are conducted.
  * Easier for companies to
    * Create products and services within the cloud
    * Model new products or marketing campaigns as cloud-based software prototypes.
* Change product design and customer experience
  * Enable closer collaboration between the corporate IT department and other business units, including sales, finance and forecasting
  * Foster more customer interaction, even to a point of jointly developing products with their consumers.
* New ways of writing and deploying software
  * Traditional software approach
    * Often has a series of relationships, called dependencies, with other lines of code, requiring big rewrites for even trivial changes
  * “Cloud native” software approach
    * Stresses ease of use and low-impact alteration of components of any given software application
    * Massive applications are subdivided into a series of “microservices” that can be tweaked with little effect on a running piece of software
    * E.g., Kubernetes
* Encourage new types of faster-acting organizational designs (“cloud native” organizations”)
  * More flexible work structure
  * IT moves from a cost center to a value enabler

## 2 Network Neutrality

* The principle that all Internet data should be treated the same
  * Internet backbone carriers should forward all data packets on a first-come, first-serve basis, allowing anyone to freely communicate with any application or content without interference from a third party
  * Prohibit network owners from discriminating against particular applications and content providers
* Examples
  * Network owners charge Web sites and application providers more for premium (i.e., higher speed) service (access tiering)
  * Network owners block competing products offered over the network (blocking)
* Opponents
  * Network providers (telecommunications and cable companies)
  * Most equitable method by which they can finance the necessary investments in their network infrastructures
  * Provide more competition among network platform
* Proponents
  * Content providers (e.g., Apple, Google, Netflix)
  * Guarantees a level playing field for all Web sites and Internet technologies
  * A neutral network encourages everyone to innovate without permission from the phone and cable companies or other authorities, and has helped to create many new businesses

## 3 Computing Ethics

### 3.1 Ethics

* A set of moral principles
* The art & science for determining good & bad, right & wrong
* Culturally/socially determined
* Evolve over time in a society to enhance coexistence

### 3.2 Computing ethics

* Deals with computer-related moral dilemmas & defines ethical principles for computer users & professionals
* Scenario Analysis
  * Using pirated software in a developing country
    > A group of USYD students volunteered for a community development project in a developing country, where they intended to teach a school of 30 young children how to use computers. Through various donations, the school had 10 computers but had only one copy & license of the windows OS CD. Is it right for the students to install the OS on these 10 computers?
  * Facebook selling data to make money
    > Facebook has decided to sell various types of data it has collected on users to 3rd party companies. Is it right for them to do this?
  * USYD monitoring network traffic
    > USYD Computer center is deliberating a new policy where they will monitor all network traffic on the university’s wired/wireless networks. You have been asked if you think this is wrong.

### 3.3 Legal vs. Ethical

* **Law** is a system of rules that are enforced through social institutions to govern behavior.
* Ethical breaches may not necessarily be criminal breaches & thus may not lead to criminal punishment.
* scenarios
  * When a customer makes online purchases, the website protects his privacy.
    * Legal & Ethical
  * An employee calls in sick to work when he/she is not really sick.
    * Legal & Not Ethical
  * Sell customer data to other companies without their permission.
    * Not Legal & Not Ethical
  * Leak information on company’s intranet to the media to stop an illegal activity that is occurring in the company.
    * Not Legal & Ethical

### 3.4 Ethical Frameworks

* The Utilitarian Approach  
  * An ethical action is the one that produces the greatest good and does the least harm.
* The Rights Approach
  * An ethical action is the one that best protects and respect the moral rights of the affected parties.
* The Fairness Approach
  * An ethical action that treat all human beings equally, or, if unequally, then fairly, based on some defensible standard.
* The Common Good Approach
  * Assumes a society comprising individuals whose own good is inseparably linked to the good of the community.
  * Community members are bound by the pursuit of common values and goals.

### 3.5 Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks

1. Recognize the ethical issue
   * Could this decision or situation damage someone or some group?
   * Does this decision involve a choice between a good and bad alternative?
   * Does this issue involve more than legal considerations? If so, in what way?
2. Get the facts
   * What are the relevant facts of situation?
   * Do I have sufficient information to make a decision?
   * Which individuals and/or groups have an important stake in the outcome?
   * Have I consulted all relevant persons and groups?
3. Evaluate alternative actions
   * What option will produce the most good and do the least harm **(the utilitarian approach)**
   * Which option best respects the rights of all stakeholders **(the right approach)**
   * Which option treats people equally or proportionately **(The fairness approach)**
   * Which option best serve the community as a whole, and not just some members? **(The common good approach)**
4. Make a decision and test it
   * Considering all the approaches, which option best addresses the situation?
5. Act and reflect on the outcome of your decision
   * How can I implement my decision with the greatest care and attention to the concerns of all stakeholders?
   * How did my decision turn out, and what did I learn from this specific situation?

## 4 Ethics and Information Technologies

* Major ethical issues:
  * Privacy
    * Involve collecting, storing, and disseminating information about individuals
  * Accuracy
    * Involve the authenticity, fidelity, and correctness of information that is collected and processed.
  * Property
    * Involve the ownership and value of information
  * Accessibility
    * Resolve around who should have access to information and whether a fee should be paid for this access

### 4.1 Privacy

* The moral right of individuals to be left alone, free from surveillance or interference from other individuals or organization
* Information privacy
  * Certain information should not be collected at all
  * Individuals to control the use of whatever information is collected about them
* IT and Privacy
  * Infringement of privacy exists prior to the Information Age
  * Increasing demand for privacy
  * ICT has made it easier for privacy abuse
    * How much personal info is collected by commercial Websites and how it will be used
    * How much personal info is collected by government authorities and how they use it
* Fair Information Principles (FIP)
  * A set of principles that governs the collection & use of information about individuals
  * Based on the notion of “Mutuality of Interest” between the Record Holder and the Individual
  * 5 Principles
    1. Notice/Awareness
       * Web sites must disclose their information practices before collecting data
       * E.g., Privacy Notice
    2. Choice
       * There must be a choice regime in place allowing consumers to choose how their information will be used for secondary purpose other than supporting the transaction
       * E.g., “We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information but we may do so in the future with trusted third parties, and you can tell us not to do so by sending an email to …”
    3. Access/Participation
       * Customer should be able to review & contest the accuracy & completeness of data collected about them in a timely, inexpensive process
       * E.g., Right to delete or edit inaccurate information
    4. Security
       * Data collectors must take responsible steps to assure that consumer information is accurate & secure from unauthorized use
       * E.g., “All of our data are protected against unauthorized access”
    5. Enforcement
       * There must be in place a mechanism to enforce FIP principles
       * E.g., Law enforcement

### 4.2 Accuracy

* Who is responsible for the authenticity, fidelity, and accuracy of the information collected?
* How can we ensure that the information will be processed properly and presented accurately to users?
* How can we ensure that errors in databases, data transmissions, and data processing are accidental and not intentional?
* Who is to be held accountable for errors in information, and how should the injured parties be compensated?

### 4.3 Property

* Question:
  * Who owns the information?
  * What are the just and fair prices for its exchange?
  * How should we handle software piracy (Copying and copyrighted software?)
  * Under what circumstance can one use proprietary databases?
  * Can corporate computers be used for private purposes?
  * How should experts who contribute their knowledge to create expert systems be compensated?
  * How should access to information channels be allocated?
* Example:
  * Terms and Conditions
  > ‘Instagram does not claim ownership of any content that you post on or through the service’ (Instagram 2013)
  >
  > ‘You hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licenced to use the content that you post on or through the service (Instagram 2013)
  * This means that
    * Instagram, although does not won or claim ownership of your content, has the right to store and use your content which has been uploaded as they see fit.
    * Essentially this means that you still "own" your content but you are granting Instagram all the same rights you have in how you deal with it.
    * The content is generally used for, but not limited to:
      * Promotions
      * Advertising
      * Commercial use

### 4.4 Accessibility

* Questions
  * Who is allowed to access information?
  * How much should companies charge for permitting access to information?
  * How can access to computers provided for employees with disabilities?
  * Who will be provided with equipment needed for accessing information?
  * What information does a person or an organization have a right to obtain, under what conditions, and with what safeguards?

### 4.5 Profiling

> Creation of digital images that characterize online individual and group behavior

* Anonymous profiles
  * Identify people as belonging to highly specific and targeted groups
* Personal profiles
  * Add personal identifiers

### 4.6 Legal and Ethical Issues Specific to the Internet

* Fraud on the Internet
  * e.g., Stock promoters falsely spread positive rumors about the prospects of the companies they touted in order to boot the companies.
* Cybersquatting
  * Registering domain names in the hope of selling them later at a higher price
* Internet Tax: Should online purchases be taxed?
  * Whether, and where, should online sellers pay taxes (e.g. sales taxes)?
  * The location of the seller? The location of the server?
  * Taxation for online transactions is still in development stages
  * Complications - different states/countries have different laws
  * How about in Australia or other parts of the world?
* Profiling
* Personal information collected by E-Commerce Sites
  * **Personally identifiable information (PII)**
  * **Anonymous information**
  * Almost all e-commerce companies collect PII and use cookies to track clickstream behavior
* Industry Self-Regulation
  * Safe harbor: Private, self-regulating policy and enforcement mechanism that meets objectives of government regulations and legislation, but does not involve government regulation or enforcement
  * Example: Privacy seal programs such as TRUSTe Internet privacy protection program
* Governance
  * Primary questions:
    * Who will control Internet and e-commerce
    * What elements will be controlled and how
* Other
  * Electronic Surveillance
    * Tracking People’s activities with the aid of information technology
    * Can be conducted by employers, the government, and other institutions.

### 4.7 ACM Code of Ethics

* Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
* ACM code of ethics is considered to be among the most innovative & far-reaching (http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html)
* Adherence to the code is largely voluntary
* “If a member does not follow this code by engaging in gross misconduct, membership in ACM may be terminated.”

### 4.8 Class Discussion / Scenario Analysis

#### 4.8.1 Ethics and Information Technology – Class Discussion

> Leikessa Jones owns her own consulting business, and has several people working for her. Leikessa is currently designing a database management system for the personnel office of ToyTimeInc., a mid-sized company that makes toys. Leikessa has involved ToyTimeInc management in the design process from the start of the project.
>
> It is now time to decide about the kind and degree of security to build into the system. Leikessa has described several options to the client. The client has decided to opt for the least secure system because the system is going to cost more than was initially planned, and the least secure option is the cheapest security option. Leikessa knows that the database includes sensitive information, such as performance evaluations, medical records, and salaries. With weak security, she fears that enterprising ToyTimeInc employees will be able to easily access this sensitive data. Furthermore, she fears that the system will be an easy target for external hackers. Leikessa strongly feels that the system should be more secure than it would be if the least secure option is selected. Ms. Jones has tried to explain the risks to ToyTimeInc, but the CEO, the CIO, and the Director of Personnel are all convinced that the cheapest security is what they want.
> Discuss whether Jones should refuse to build the system with the least secure option.
