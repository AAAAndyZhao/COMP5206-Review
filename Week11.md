- Identifies the firm's overall mission, goals, and objectives that follow from that mission, and the broad steps required to reach these goals.

**IT Architecture**:

- Outlines the way an organisation should utilize its information resources to accomplish its mission.

- Technical aspects encompassed
  - Hardware and Operating Systems, networks, databases, applications, and programming languages, data management systems, and application software.

- Managerial aspects encompassed
  - How IT department will be managed
  - How the functional area managers will be involved in the IT decision making process
  - How IT decisions will be made and prioritized among competing demands for resources.

## 2. IS Planning ##

**IT Stragetic Plan**:

- A set of long-range goals that describe the IT infrastructure and identify the major IT initiatives needed to achieve the organization’s goals.
- A good IT strategic plan must meet three **objectives**:
  - Aligns with the business strategic plan
  - Provides for an IT architecture that seamlessly networks users, applications, and databases
  - Allocates IS development resources efficiently among competing projects. So the projects can be completed on time and within budget and still have the required functionality.

- **IT Steering Committee**
  - Comprised of group of managers and staff representing various organisational units
    - To establish IT priorities
    - To ensure that the IS function is meeting the needs of the enterprise.

**IS Operational Plan**:

Consists of a clear set of projects that the IS department and the functional area managers will execute in support of the IT strategic plan.

- Mission: the mission of the IS function
- IS Environment: the summary of information needs of the functional areas and of the organisation as a whole
- Objectives of IS Function: The best current estimate of the goals of the IS function.
- Constraints: Technological, financial, personnel, and other resource limitations on the IS function.
- Applications Portfolio: A prioritized inventory of present applications and a detailed plan of projects to be developed or continued during the current year.
- Resource Allocation and Project Management: A listing of how, when and who is going to do that.
  
## 3. Decision Structure and Systems ##

- **Nature of Decisions**:
  - Operational: Executing specific tasks efficiently and effectively.
  - Managerial: Acquiring and allocating resources efficiently and effectively in accomplishing organisational goals.
  - Strategic: Long-term goals and policies for growth and resource allocation.

## 4. Making the Business Case for an IS ##

Making the business case for an IS:

- Faith.
- Fear.
- Facts.
  
## 5. Justifying IT Investments ##

- An IS must be implemented in order to gain or sustain a competitive advantage over rivals, or simply to stay in business.
- Based on Faith:
  - Arguments based on beliefs about organizational strategy competitive advantage, industry forces, customer perceptions, market share, and so on.
- Based on Fear:
  - Arguments based on the notion that if the system is not implemented, the firm will lose out to the competition, or, worse, go out of business.
- Based on Facts:
  - Arguments based on data, quantitative analysis, and/or indisputable factors.

## 6. Cost-Benefit Analysis ##

Assessing the Costs:

- Challenging in allocating fixed costs among different IT projects:
  - Costs that remain the same regardless of any change in the company’s activity level.
  - Include infrastructure costs and costs associated with IT services and IT management (e.g., salary of IT director).
- Challenge in anticipating costs for maintaining, debugging, and improving systems after installed.

Assessing the Benefits:

- Difficulty in quantifying intangible benefits (e.g., improved customer or partner relations, improved decision making, etc.).

Methods:

- Net Present Value (NPV)
  - Convert future values of benefits to their present-value equivalent by “discounting” them at the organization’s costs of funds.
  - Compare the present value of the future benefits to the cost required to achieve those benefits to determine whether the benefits exceed the costs.

- Return on Investment (ROI)
  - Measures management’s effectiveness in generating profits with its available assets.
  - Divide the net income generated by the average assets invested.
  - The high the percentage the better.
- Break-Even Analysis
  - Determine the point at which the cumulative dollar value of the benefits equals the investment made.

## 7. IS Development and Acquisition Decisions ##

- How much computer code does the company want to write?
  - Use a totally prewritten application (write no code)
  - Customize a prewritten application (write some code)
  - Customize an entire application (write all new code)
- How will the company pay for the application?
  - Prewritten applications: buy or lease
  - Totally custom applications: internal funding
- Where will the application run?
  - Run the application on its own platform
  - Run the application on someone else’s platform (e.g., SaaS vendor)
- Where will the application originate?
  - Prewritten applications: open source or proprietary
  - Custom applications: in-house or outsource

## 8. IS Development and Acquisition Strategy ##

In-house development:

- System Development Life Cycle(SDLC)
  - A structured framework for developing new systems or changing existing systems.
  - A set of activities used to build an information system.
  - A set of techniques and tools to aid in the development process.
  - A guide to help the project manager and team plan, schedule, and control the project.

External Acquisition:

- Off-the-shelf (proprietary) software
- Open source software
- Application Service Provider (ASP) and Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Outsourcing
