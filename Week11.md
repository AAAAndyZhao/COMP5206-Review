# Week 11 #

## 1. IS Planning Process ##

**Orgainsational Strategic Plan**:

![Organisational Strategic Plan](picture/L11-P1.png)

- Identifies the firm's overall mission, goals, and objectives that follow from that mission, and the broad steps required to reach these goals.

**IT Architecture**:

- Outlines the way an organisation should utilize its information resources to accomplish its mission.

- Technical aspects encompassed
  - Hardware and Operating Systems, networks, databases, applications, and programming languages, data management systems, and application software.

- Managerial aspects encompassed
  - How IT department will be managed
  - How the functional area managers will be involved in the IT decision making process
  - How IT decisions will be made and prioritized among competing demands for resources.

## 2. IS Planning ##

**IT Stragetic Plan**:

- A set of long-range goals that describe the IT infrastructure and identify the major IT initiatives needed to achieve the organization’s goals.
- A good IT strategic plan must meet three **objectives**:
  - Aligns with the business strategic plan
  - Provides for an IT architecture that seamlessly networks users, applications, and databases
  - Allocates IS development resources efficiently among competing projects. So the projects can be completed on time and within budget and still have the required functionality.

- **IT Steering Committee**
  - Comprised of group of managers and staff representing various organisational units
    - To establish IT priorities
    - To ensure that the IS function is meeting the needs of the enterprise.

**IS Operational Plan**:

Consists of a clear set of projects that the IS department and the functional area managers will execute in support of the IT strategic plan.

- Mission: the mission of the IS function
- IS Environment: the summary of information needs of the functional areas and of the organisation as a whole
- Objectives of IS Function: The best current estimate of the goals of the IS function.
- Constraints: Technological, financial, personnel, and other resource limitations on the IS function.
- Applications Portfolio: A prioritized inventory of present applications and a detailed plan of projects to be developed or continued during the current year.
- Resource Allocation and Project Management: A listing of how, when and who is going to do that.
  
## 3. Decision Structure and Systems ##

- **Nature of Decisions**:
  - Operational: Executing specific tasks efficiently and effectively.
  - Managerial: Acquiring and allocating resources efficiently and effectively in accomplishing organisational goals.
  - Strategic: Long-term goals and policies for growth and resource allocation.

## 4. Making the Business Case for an IS ##

Making the business case for an IS:

- Faith.
- Fear.
- Facts.
  
## 5. Justifying IT Investments ##

- An IS must be implemented in order to gain or sustain a competitive advantage over rivals, or simply to stay in business.
- Based on Faith:
  - Arguments based on beliefs about organizational strategy competitive advantage, industry forces, customer perceptions, market share, and so on.
- Based on Fear:
  - Arguments based on the notion that if the system is not implemented, the firm will lose out to the competition, or, worse, go out of business.
- Based on Facts:
  - Arguments based on data, quantitative analysis, and/or indisputable factors.

## 6. Cost-Benefit Analysis ##

Assessing the Costs:

- Challenging in allocating fixed costs among different IT projects:
  - Costs that remain the same regardless of any change in the company’s activity level.
  - Include infrastructure costs and costs associated with IT services and IT management (e.g., salary of IT director).
- Challenge in anticipating costs for maintaining, debugging, and improving systems after installed.

Assessing the Benefits:

- Difficulty in quantifying intangible benefits (e.g., improved customer or partner relations, improved decision making, etc.).

Methods:

- Net Present Value (NPV)
  - Convert future values of benefits to their present-value equivalent by “discounting” them at the organization’s costs of funds.
  - Compare the present value of the future benefits to the cost required to achieve those benefits to determine whether the benefits exceed the costs.

- Return on Investment (ROI)
  - Measures management’s effectiveness in generating profits with its available assets.
  - Divide the net income generated by the average assets invested.
  - The high the percentage the better.
- Break-Even Analysis
  - Determine the point at which the cumulative dollar value of the benefits equals the investment made.

## 7. IS Development and Acquisition Decisions ##

- How much computer code does the company want to write?
  - Use a totally prewritten application (write no code)
  - Customize a prewritten application (write some code)
  - Customize an entire application (write all new code)
- How will the company pay for the application?
  - Prewritten applications: buy or lease
  - Totally custom applications: internal funding
- Where will the application run?
  - Run the application on its own platform
  - Run the application on someone else’s platform (e.g., SaaS vendor)
- Where will the application originate?
  - Prewritten applications: open source or proprietary
  - Custom applications: in-house or outsource

| Preventive | Making changes to reduce the chance of future system failure. |

## 26. System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) ##

Advantages:

- Forces staff to systematically go through every step in a structured process
- Enforcesqualitybymaintaining standards
- Has lower probability of missing important issues in collecting user requirements.

Disadvantages:

- May produce excessive documentation
- Users may be unwilling or unable to studytheapprovedspecifications
- Takes too long to go from the original ideas to a working system
- Users have trouble describing requirements for a proposed system

## 27. Alternative Methods and Tools ##

- Joint Application Design (JAD)
  - A group-based tool for collecting user requirements and creating system designs
- Prototyping
  - An approach that defines an initial list of user requirements,builds a model (prototype) of the system, and then refines the systems in several iterations based on users’ feedback.
- Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE)
  - A group of tools that automate many of the tasks in the SDLC.
    - Upper CASE tools: Automate early stages of SDLC
    - Lower CASE tools: Automate later stages of SDLC
    - Integrated CASE tools: provide links between upper CASE and lower CASE tools.
- RAD (Rapid Application Development)
  - A method that combines JAD, prototyping, and integrated CASE tools to compress the time required to design and implement information systems.
- Agile Development
  - A software development methodology that delivers functionality in rapid iterations, measured in weeks, requiring frequent communication, development, testing, and delivery.
- End-User Development
  - An approach in which the organisation's end users develop their own applications with assistance from the IT department.
- Object-Oriented Development
  - A software development methodology that begins with aspects of the real world that must be modelled to perform a task and that organises work around the data, or objects, rather than the processes.

- Proposal Evaluation
- Vendor Selection

## 29. Off-the-Shelf Software ##

- Advantages
  - Many different types of off-the-shelf software are available.
  - Software can be tried out before purchase.
  - The compnay can save much time by purchasing off-the-shelf software rather than developing its own.
  - The company can know what it is getting before it invests in the software.
  - The company is not the first and only user of the software.
  - Purchased software may eliminate the need to hire and train new employees.
- Disadvantages
  - Software may not meet all of the company's needs.
  - Software may be difficult to integrate with existing systems, or it may require huge business process changes.
  - The company will not have control over software improvements.
  - Purchased software can be difficult to integrate with existing systems.
  - Vendors may discontinue support for the software.
  - Software is controlled by another company with its own priorities and goals.
  - Intimate knowledge in the purchasing company is lacking about how the software works.
