Q: **How do you relate social computing and social media? Explore the following link and discuss in the breakout room ?**

A: Social computing and social media are intrinsically intertwined. Social computing, as a field in computer science, examines the connection between social behavior and computational systems. It plays an essential role in enabling and enhancing functionalities that we now take for granted in social media platforms.

For instance, social computing facilitates two-way communication on web apps, transforming the way we interact with digital platforms. This phenomenon is evident in social media applications like Facebook and Twitter, where users can upload a variety of content, comment on others' content, and connect with people across the globe instantly.

Social media apps, with their large user bases, have leveraged social computing to introduce new disruptive approaches that enhance businesses in several ways. Social computing has allowed these platforms to empower users through user-generated content that is shared freely. Moreover, businesses have used these platforms to their advantage, such as by uploading deals and catalogs, significantly impacting e-businesses.

Furthermore, social computing has a profound influence on social behavior in the context of social media apps. It's changing user behaviors and their daily routines, with social media apps becoming increasingly popular. Social computing also affects organizational computing modes and management structures. For example, social media enables employees to communicate with managers in a person-to-person fashion, potentially impacting traditional hierarchical structures within organizations.

Without the paradigm of social computing, social media would not be as we know it today. The advancements in social computing have greatly contributed to the current state of social media, catering to the needs of our tech-heavy generation. Future developments in social computing are anticipated to further enhance aspects of social media, underscoring its pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of social media evolution.

Q: **How do Australian business use social media?**
A: Social computing, which is the intersection of computational systems and social behavior, has significantly influenced the landscape of social media and the way businesses interact with it. Social media platforms enable businesses to leverage user-generated content and engage with customers directly, making it a powerful tool for marketing, customer service, and even internal communication. It can lead to changes in the styles of organizational computing modes and management structure, as the traditional hierarchical structure might be impacted because employees can communicate with managers in a more direct manner on these platforms. This effect is not exclusive to Australian businesses but is a global trend​​.

As of January 2023, there were 21.3 million social media users in Australia, making up 81.0% of the total population. Among these users, 54.2% were female, and 45.8% were male. There were also 18.85 million users aged 18 and above, representing 91.5% of the total population in this age group. Furthermore, 84.2% of the total internet user base in Australia used at least one social media platform. In terms of platform-specific data, Facebook had 14.90 million users in Australia in early 2023, which was equivalent to 56.6% of the total population, or 67.1% of the "eligible" audience (people aged 13 and above)​​.

The high penetration of social media use in Australia indicates that businesses can reach a large portion of the population through these platforms. However, the specific strategies and ways Australian businesses utilize social media for their operations might vary and would require more detailed research.

media networking platforms about
– Gathering user-generated content, third-party comments, reviews
– Establishing social customer relationship management?

A: **Content Moderation**: Having a robust content moderation policy can prevent harmful or off-brand content from appearing on your platforms. This can include monitoring comments, reviews, and user-generated content for appropriateness and relevance.
**Data Security and Privacy**: Ensure robust data security measures to protect user data. This includes adhering to all local laws and regulations regarding data privacy and obtaining informed consent from users before collecting or using their data.
**Establishing Social CRM**: Engage with customers on social media platforms where they are most active. Offer customer service through these platforms, and use them to gather feedback and insights about your products or services.

Q2: Discuss any FOUR learnings from the cases reviewed.

The case studies provided have highlighted a few critical points:

**Business Operations and Liability**: Facebook's claim that it does not conduct business in Australia to avoid liability in the Cambridge Analytica scandal was rejected by Justice Thomas Thawley, who found that Facebook did collect and store information in Australia, demonstrating that companies can be considered to be conducting business in a country even if they do not have a physical presence there​1​.

**Data Privacy Laws**: Companies must be aware of different data privacy laws in different countries. Facebook's argument that it does not collect or hold data on Australian users in Australia was dismissed, showing the importance of adhering to local data privacy laws even for global companies​1​.

**Government Intervention**: The Australian government has been proactive in taking measures to ensure the compliance of foreign companies like Facebook. Businesses should be prepared for increased scrutiny and regulation from governments worldwide​1​.

**Impact of Policy Changes**: Changes in policies, such as Facebook's decision to block news content in Australia, can have significant impacts on businesses, consumers, and the digital media landscape. Businesses should consider the wider implications of their policies and actions​1​.
