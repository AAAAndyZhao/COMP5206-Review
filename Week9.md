# Week 9 #

## 1. Information Security ##

- Information Security
  - All of the processes and policies designed to protect an organization’s information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction.
- Threat
  - Any danger which a system may be exposed.
- Vulnerability
  - The possibility that the system will be harmed by a threat.
- Factors contributing to the increasing vulnerability of   organizational resources:
  - Today’s interconnected, interdependent, wirelessly networked businessenvironment
  - Smaller, faster, cheaper computers and storage devices
  - Decreasing skills necessary to be a computer hacker
  - Internationally organized crime
  - Lack of management support

### 1.1. Information Security Threats ###

- Malware from Internet
- Denial of Service from Internet
- Unauthorized Users from Internet
- Natural Disasters (floods, storms)
- Man-Made Disasters (Fire, Power Outage, other accidents)
- Application Progammer
- System Administrator
- Operators
- Users
- System Software
- Other Insiders
- Hardware Threats
- Terminal
- PCS
- Databases

### 1.2. Unintentional Threats ###

Acts performed without malicious intent that nevertheless represent a serious threat to IS security.

- Human Errors
- Social Engineering: An attack in which the criminal uses social skills to manipulate legitimate employees into providing confidential company information such as passwords.
- Tailgating:A wrongdoer enters restricted areas by following closely behind a legitimate employee.
- Shoulder Surfing: A wrongdoer observes an employee’s computer screen over the employee’s shoulder.

### 1.3. Deliberate Threats ###

- Software attacks
- Alien software
- Identify theft
- Theft of equipment and information
- Spying or trespass
  - Occurs when an unauthorized individual attempts to gain illegal access to organizational information
- Information extortion
  - Occurs when an attacker either threatens to steal, or actually steals, information from a company
- Sabotage and vandalism
  - Deliberate acts that involve defacing an organization’s Web site, possibly causing the organization to lose its image and experience a loss of confidence by its customers
- Cyberterrorism and cyberwarfare
  - Malicious acts in which attackers use a target’s computer systems, particularly via the Internet, to cause physical, real-world harm or severe disruption, usually to carry out a political agenda

### 1.4. Software Attacks ###

Occur when malicious software (malware) penetrates an organization’s computer system.

Remote attacks requiring user action

- Virus
  - Segment of computer code that performs malicious actions by attaching to another computer program.
- Worm
  - Segment of computer code that performs malicious actions and will replicate, or spread, by itself (without requiring another computer program).
- Phishing
  - Attack that uses deception to acquire sensitive personal information by masquerading as official-looking emails or instant messages.
- Spear phishing
  - Target a specific person or organization by personalizing the message.
  - The perpetrators find out as much information about an individual as possible to improve their chances that phishing techniques will be able to obtain sensitive, personal information.
- Ransomeware
  - locks up the files on your computer and encrypts them in a way that you cannot access them anymore.
  - **How does it spread?**
    - Ransomware is a program that gets into your computer, either by clicking on the wrong thing or downloading the wrong thing, and then it holds something you need to exchange or pay.
    - it can also spread through phishing emails or via a website containing a malicious program.
    - WannaCry is not just a ransomware program, it's also a worm, This means that it gets into your computer and looks for other computers to try and spread itself as far and wide as possible.
    - (Signs of a Scam) This means that it gets into your computer and looks for other computers to try and spread itself as far and wide as possible, including: the email, text or phone call is unexpected; there's a deadline or sense of urgency; there's a promise of financial benefit or a threat of fines, debts or jail.
- Trojan horse
  - A software program containing a hidden function that presents a security risk
- Back door
  - Typically a password, known only to the attacker, that allows him or her to access computer system at will, without having to go through any security procedures.
- Logical Bomb  
  - Segment of computer code that is embedded within an organization’s existing computer programs and is designed to activate and perform a destructive action at a certain time or date.
- Denial-of-service attack (DoS)
  - A cyber attack in which an attacker sends a flood of data packets to the target computer, which the aim of overloading its resources.
  - Attacker sends so many information requests to a target computer system that the target cannot handle them successfully and typically crashes.
- Distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS)
  - A denial-of-service attack that sends a flood of data packets from many compromised computers simultaneously
  - An attacker first takes over many computers (bots or zombies), typically by using malicious software, to form a botnet. The attacker uses the botnet to deliver a coordinated stream of information requests to a target computer, causing it to crash

Secret software that is installed on your computer through two-faced methods

- Typically not as malicious as viruses, worms, or Trojan horses, but does use up valuable system resources
- May report on your Web surfing habits and other personal behavior
- Adware
  - Software that causes pop-up advertisements to appear on your screen
- Spyware
  - Software that collects personal information about users without their consent
  - Keyloggers (Keystroke loggers)
    - Spyware that captures keystrokes
  - Screen scrapers (screen grabbers)
    - Software that records a continuous “move” of a screen’s contents rather than simply recording keystrokes.
- Spamware
  - Pestware that uses your computer as a launch pad for spammers.
  - Spam: Unsolicited electronic messages, usually for the purpose of advertising products and/or services
- Cookies
  - Small amounts of information that Web sites store on your computer, temporarily or more or less permanently

### 1.5. Identify Theft ###

The deliberate assumption of another person’s identity and uses his or her personal information for some fraud

- Obtaining personal information by
  - Stealing mail or dumpster diving
    - The practice of rummaging through commercial or residential trash to find information that has been discarded
  - Stealing personal information from computer databases
  - Insightful organizations that store large amounts of personal information
  - Impersonating a trusted organization in an electronic communication (phishing)

### 1.6. Organisational Information Leakage ###

Information leakage as “a breach of the confidentiality of information.”
Organizations face more challenges in protecting their information due to employees’ careless behaviour while using Online Social Network (OSN) that leads to unintended leakage of confidential and sensitive information.
The flow of information published on OSN sites is difficult to control since it can be stored in various formats, copied and distributed to other people.

### 1.7 IS Security Risk Management ###

1. IS security risk
   - The probability that a security threat will impact an information resource
2. Goal of risk management
   - The probability that a security threat will impact an information resource
   - To reduce risk to acceptable levels
3. Risk management process
   - Risk analysis
   - Risk mitigation
   - Controls evaluation

#### 1.7.1 Risk Analysis ####

Three Steps:

1. Assessing the value of each asset being protected
2. Estimating the probability that each asset will be compromised
3. Comparing the probable costs of the asset’s being compromised with the costs of protecting that asset

#### 1.7.2 Risk Mitigation ####
